# Chinese Investments Dashboard
Project by Garda Ramadhito, Daryl Kow, Marc Castillo, Kagen Lim

## Project Title
China's Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)

## Project Objective
Through a dashboard, we visualize Chinaâ€™s growth in outward-oriented foreign investments. We do this at the level of the entire world, and also at the level of a single continent, Africa, where Chinese Investments have been on the rise over the years; it is one key part of the world where experts expect US-China competition to intensify.

## Key Components
1. World Map - Where is China investing in?
2. Yearly Investments by Categories - What is China investing in?
3. Outgoing FDI - Is China really investing more than the US?
4. Next Frontier: Africa - What do we know about how China is investing in Africa?
